# Reading a data file and working with it: 
# a) Read the file first and store it in a.
# b) How many rows are there in this table? How many columns are there? 
# c) How to find the number of rows and number of columns by a single command?
# d) What are the variables in the data file?
# e) If the file is very large, naturally we cannot simply type `a', because it will cover the entire screen and we won't be able to understand anything. 
#    So how to see the top or bottom few lines in this file?
# f) If the number of columns is too large, again we may face the same problem. So how to see the first 5 rows and first 3 columns?
# g) How to get 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 10th row and 2nd, 4th, and 5th column? h) How to get values in a specific row or a column?
